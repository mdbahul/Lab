1. Write a  program to implement queue using linked list.
                                 OR
 Write a  program to implement stack using linked list.

2. Josepus problem: n students have decided to elect a leader (class representative). They form a circle a number m and a name of the student is picked. Beginning with the student whose name is picked, the begin to count clockwise around the circle. When count reaches $n$, that student is removed from circle and the count begins again with next student. The process continues so that each time the count reaches $n$, another student is removed from the circle. Any student removed from the circle is no longer counted. The last student remaining is the leader. Write a program to determine the order in which students are eliminated from the circle and which student escapes.
For example, the persons in circular list are: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7  
Enter the number of persons to be skipped: 3
3 has been killed. 6 has been killed. 2 has been killed. 7 has been killed. 5 has been killed. 1 has been killed. The person to survive is : 4.
 
3. Write a program to check whether linear linked list has a loop or not.
 
4. A) Write a program to create a circular linked list with n nodes. Write a program to display the node information and to find number of elements in the circular list. 
B) Write a program to insert a node after kth node in circular linked list.
C) Write a program to delete a node after kth node in circular linked list.
 
5. A) Write a program to create a double linked list with n nodes. Write a program to display the node information and to find number of elements in the double linked list.
B) Write a program to insert a node after kth node in double linked list.
C) Write a program to delete a node after kth node in double linked list.
